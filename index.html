        <dt>Ananymous
          <dd>About and why you joined: Hi, I'm 16 and I am curious about this I guess lol.</dd>
        </dt>
        <dt>Caden Luzilli
          <dd>About and why you joined: I had always been interested in the lost world of atlantis since I was a kid. I currently reside in France but was at an extended trip
            the Pacific and was shocked to see that the locals had sighted the exact creatures I had seen and heard of when I was a child. I have a feeling this is not a fairy tale after all
          </dd>
        </dt>
        <dt>Ananymous
          <dd>About and why you joined: 31 years in photography, programming, historical sciences, and cryptography. A big persuit of mine is to get to the bottom of the world
            of Atlantis. Such beings and existence could provide humanity great direction in the scientific field, I am an athiest, I do not believe in God at all. What I do know
            from my studies in history Is that these creatures and Atlantis as a whole once existed around 2000BC including the akani race and the atlanteans. Furthermore, the thing
            that got me to this state is a relatively recent encounter 2 years in the east pacific, glowing architecture at the bottom of the ocean was seen and photographed. I am being
            persued by many elite and government bodies. I must stay ananymous but for the sake of this mission and interest I will provide all I safely can.

      <h1>About Project Atlantis</h1>
      <h4>The Mission</h4>
        <p>Our mission is to learn more about Atlantis, Atlanteans, and eventually make contact with their people and coexist.</p><br><br><br>
      <h4>The Beginning</h4>
        <p>Alexander and Coswell were the last offical and confirmed individuals to make contact with the atlantean race. After their encounter they decided to remap
          their life mission to uncovering the mystery behind the atlantean race (which after the initial has been unsuccessful) as well as their home - Atlantis. Both
          underwent extensive personal transformations intellectually and spiritually to further persue contact and gather new information. Much of their documentation 
          has been lost or confiscated since the death of both but their legacy lives on. This organization was founded in spring of 1793 by Alexander and this is what remains.<br><br><br>
        </p><br><br><br>
      <h4>The Founders</h4>
      <p>Founded in 1790 and established in 1793 by business partners and Friends, Coswell Owens the Second and Alexander A. Jhonasna. They were the last official and confirmed human beings to make contact with the atlanteans
        Further information can be provided in their biographies and Alexander's book: <em>Consuquentio La Atlantean</em>.
